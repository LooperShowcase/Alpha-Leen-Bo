      JAMESTOWN — When Title IX was passed into law in 1972, it opened the door
      for women’s sports to start all around the country, including at Jamestown
      College, where they started a women’s basketball team in 1975.

      The team’s first-ever head coach was Dennis Van Berkum who was hired by
      Rollie Greeno because of his previous experience coaching girls
      basketball. Van Berkum said Greeno didn’t give him a choice on whether to
      coach the women’s basketball team, he was told that he was continuing to
      coach on the football team and that he would coach the baseball team and
      the women’s basketball team

      “I was inexperienced in college basketball, actually I walked into
      Rollie’s office, I was hired in the summer of that year,” Van Berkum said.
      “I knew very little about it. The women that participated all of them were
      volunteers, Jeanne Tews, I think, was the only one that was scholarship …
      They all were just great gals that wanted to play some basketball. That’s
      really what it comes down to.”
