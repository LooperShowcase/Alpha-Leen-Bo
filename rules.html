    <p>
      On 15 January 1892, James Naismith published his rules for the game of
      "Basket Ball" that he invented:[1] The original game played under these
      rules was quite different from the one played today as there was no
      dribbling, dunking, three-pointers, or shot clock, and goal tending was
      legal
    </p>
    <p>1.The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.</p>
    <p>
      2.The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands (never
      with fist)
    </p>
    <p>
      3.A player cannot run with the ball, the player must throw it from the
      spot on which he catches it, allowance to be made for a man who catches
      the ball when running at a good speed
    </p>
    <p>
      4.The ball must be held in or between the hands; the arms or body must not
      be used for holding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the
      person of an opponent shall be allowed. The first infringement of this
      rule by any person shall count as a foul; the second shall disqualify him
      until the next goal is made or, if there was evident intent to injure the
      person, for the whole of the game. No substitute allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.A foul is striking at the ball with the fist, violation of rules 3 and
      4, and such described in rule 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.If either side makes three consecutive fouls, it shall count a goal for
      the opponents (consecutive means without the opponents in the meantime
      making a foul).
    </p>
    <p>
      8.A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from the grounds
      into the basket and stays there (without falling), providing those
      defending the goal do not touch or disturb the goal. If the ball rests on
      the edge, and the opponent moves the basket, it shall count as a goal
    </p>
    <p>
      9.When the ball goes out of bounds it shall be thrown into the field and
      played by the first person touching it. In case of dispute the umpire
      shall throw it straight into the field. The thrower in is allowed five
      seconds, if he holds it longer, it shall go to the opponent. If any side
      persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      10.The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls, and
      notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made. He shall
      have power to disqualify people according to Rule 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      11.The referee shall be judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball
      is in play, in bounds, to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time.
      He shall decide when a goal has been made and keep account of the goals
      with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.
    </p>
    <p>
      12.The time shall be two fifteen minute halves, with five minutes rest
      between.
    </p>
    <p>
      13.The side making the most goals in that time is declared the winner. In
      case of a draw the game may, by agreement of the captain, be continued
      until another goal is made.
