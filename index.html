    <h1>basketball</h1>
    <p>
      Basketball, game played between two teams of five players each on a
      rectangular court, usually indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing
      the ball through the opponent’s goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net
      called a basket.
    </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      In the early years the number of players on a team varied according to the
      number in the class and the size of the playing area. In 1894 teams began
      to play with five on a side when the playing area was less than 1,800
      square feet (167.2 square metres); the number rose to seven when the
      gymnasium measured from 1,800 to 3,600 square feet (334.5 square metres)
      and up to nine when the playing area exceeded that. In 1895 the number was
      occasionally set at five by mutual consent; the rules stipulated five
      players two years later, and this number has remained ever since.

    <h3>Growth of the game</h3>
    <p>
      Basketball grew steadily but slowly in popularity and importance in the
      United States and internationally in the first three decades after World
      War II. Interest in the game deepened as a result of television exposure,
      but with the advent of cable television, especially during the 1980s, the
      game’s popularity exploded at all levels. Given a timely mix of
      spectacular players—such as Earvin (“Magic”) Johnson, Julius Erving (“Dr.
      J”), Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan—and the greatly increased exposure,
      basketball moved quickly to the forefront of the American sporting scene,
      alongside such traditional leaders as baseball and football. Four areas of
      the game developed during this period: U.S. high school and college
      basketball, professional basketball, women’s basketball, and international
      basketball

    <b>College basketball</b>
    <p>
      Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the
      United States, and it quickly spread through the United States and Canada.
      By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools. While
      YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game,
      within a decade it discouraged the new sport, as rough play and rowdy
      crowds began to detract from YMCA's primary mission. However, other
      amateur sports clubs, colleges, and professional clubs quickly filled the
      void. In the years before World War I, the Amateur Athletic Union and the
      Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (forerunner of
      the NCAA) vied for control over the rules for the game. The first pro
      league, the National Basketball League, was formed in 1898 to protect
      players from exploitation and to promote a less rough game. This league
      only lasted five years.

    <b>Playing regulations </b>
    <p>
      The rules of basketball can vary slightly depending on the level of play
      (for example professional rules differ from college rules) or where the
      game is played (international rules are different from USA professional
      rules). These rule differences, however, are usually just variations on
      the basic game of basketball and the majority of the rules discussed below
      can be applied to most any game of basketball played. The winner of a
      basketball game is the team with the most points. You get points by
      throwing the basketball through the opponent's hoop or basket. In regular
      play a basket made from within the three point line is worth 2 points and
      a basket shot from outside the three point line is worth three points.
      When shooting a free throw, each free throw is worth 1 point.
    </p>
    <b>Rules for the offense </b>
    <p>
      1. The player must bounce, or dribble, the ball with one hand while moving
      both feet. If, at any time, both hands touch the ball or the player stops
      dribbling, the player must only move one foot. The foot that is stationary
      is called the pivot foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The basketball player can only take one turn at dribbling. In other
      words, once a player has stopped dribbling they cannot start another
      dribble. A player who starts dribbling again is called for a
      double-dribbling violation and looses the basketball to the other team. A
      player can only start another dribble after another player from either
      team touches or gains control of the basketball. This is usually after a
      shot or pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The ball must stay in bounds. If the offensive team looses the ball out
      of bounds the other team gets control of the basketball.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. The players hand must be on top of the ball while dribbling. If they
      touch the bottom of the basketball while dribbling and continue to dribble
      this is called carrying the ball and the player will lose the ball to the
      other team.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Once the offensive team crosses half court, they may not go back into
      the backcourt. This is called a backcourt violation. If the defensive team
      knocks the ball into the backcourt, then the offensive team can recover
      the ball legally.
